  <p class=""><strong>Updated July 2025</strong></p><p class="">When we think of shredding, our minds often jump to paper documents or digital media. But did you know that <strong>textile shredding</strong> is just as essential in many industries? From protecting brand identity to ensuring public safety, shredding clothing and textiles plays a critical role in responsible waste management and security protocols.</p><h3><strong>What Is Textile Shredding?</strong></h3><p class=""><strong>Textile shredding</strong> is the process of destroying unwanted or outdated clothing, uniforms, and fabric materials to prevent their reuse or repurposing. This secure destruction ensures that sensitive or branded items do not end up in the wrong hands or create liabilities for the business or organization that originally owned them.</p><p class="">Whether you're running a hotel, medical facility, retail store, or public service agency, textile shredding provides an added layer of protection for your brand, reputation, and customers.</p><h3><br><strong>1. Brand Protection: Destroying Branded Textiles Safely</strong></h3><p class="">For companies that produce or distribute branded merchandise, apparel, or linens, <strong>textile destruction</strong> is crucial for protecting their brand image. Once these items are no longer usable, simply discarding them in the trash can lead to unintended consequences.</p><h4><strong>Why Brand Protection Matters:</strong></h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Prevent counterfeit or unauthorized resale</strong>: Old uniforms or branded gear could be picked up and sold second-hand, misleading consumers and damaging brand integrity.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Protect company reputation</strong>: Discarded branded textiles can be misused or appear in inappropriate settings, which may reflect poorly on your business.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Reduce liability risks</strong>: If an old branded uniform is used for fraudulent purposes, your business could be held responsible.</p></li></ul><p class="">Items like uniforms, T-shirts, promotional hats, branded blankets, aprons, or linens that carry your logo or name should be securely shredded to eliminate the risk of misuse.</p><p class="">Many businesses—particularly <strong>hotels, restaurants, retailers, and fitness centers</strong>—are now opting for <strong>professional textile shredding services</strong> to properly dispose of outdated branded materials.<br></p><h3><strong>2. Uniform Shredding for Public Safety and Security</strong></h3><p class=""><strong>Uniform shredding</strong> is not just about protecting brands—it can also be a matter of public safety. In sectors like law enforcement, firefighting, EMS, and healthcare, uniforms signify authority and access to restricted areas.</p><h4><strong>Why Uniforms Must Be Shredded:</strong></h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Prevent impersonation</strong>: Old police, firefighter, military, or paramedic uniforms in the wrong hands could be used for criminal activity or unauthorized access.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Ensure confidentiality</strong>: Shredding medical scrubs or contaminated garments protects patients, healthcare workers, and institutions from biohazard risks and HIPAA violations.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Avoid brand damage</strong>: Public service agencies are held to high standards. Improper disposal of uniforms can result in reputational damage and public distrust.</p></li></ul><p class="">Uniforms from <strong>protective services</strong>, including <strong>police departments, fire stations, EMS units, and hospitals</strong>, should <strong>never be donated or discarded</strong> in public waste. Instead, they must be shredded and securely disposed of by certified textile shredding companies.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h3><strong>3. Sustainability Through Textile Recycling and Shredding</strong></h3><p class="">Textile shredding isn’t just about security—it can also be a part of your company’s <strong>sustainability and waste reduction</strong> strategy. Shredded textile material can often be processed and repurposed into new materials, such as insulation, carpet padding, or industrial rags.</p><p class="">Using a certified textile shredding service ensures:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Environmentally responsible disposal</p></li><li><p class="">Compliance with recycling best practices</p></li><li><p class="">Reduction of landfill waste</p></li></ul><p class="">Textile waste accounts for a significant portion of global landfill content. By working with a trusted shredding provider, you not only protect your company—you also contribute to a greener future.<br></p><h3><strong>Why Alberta Businesses Trust Merlin Shredding for Textile Disposal</strong></h3><p class="">At <strong>Merlin Shredding</strong>, we understand that <strong>secure textile destruction</strong> is more than a service—it’s a responsibility. Our high-capacity, heavy-duty industrial shredders can process <strong>large volumes of fabric, uniforms, and textiles</strong>, making us the trusted partner for companies across Alberta.</p><h4><strong>What Sets Us Apart:</strong></h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>NAID AAA Certified</strong>: Our secure processes meet the highest standards for information and materials destruction.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Mobile shredding services</strong>: We come to you to provide services when you need them.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Efficient service</strong>: We are able to shred high volumes of textiles in a fast and efficient manner.</p></li></ul><p class="">Whether you need to destroy contaminated scrubs, decommissioned uniforms, or excess branded merchandise, <strong>Merlin Shredding</strong> ensures complete and secure destruction every time.</p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>—</strong></p><p class=""><strong>Why shred textiles?</strong> Because in today’s world, protecting your business goes far beyond paper and hard drives. <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/textile-shredding"><strong>Textile shredding</strong></a> ensures your brand stays protected, your uniforms don’t become liabilities, and your materials are responsibly handled.</p><p class="">If you're looking for a secure, certified, and efficient way to dispose of your company’s textiles, uniforms, or branded clothing, <strong>Merlin Shredding</strong> has the tools and expertise to do the job right.</p><p class=""><a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/contact-us"><strong>Contact us today</strong></a> to learn more about our textile shredding services or to request a quote for your next shredding project.</p><p class=""><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>8 Surprising Things You Should Be Shredding… But Probably Aren’t</title><dc:creator>Guest User</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2025 02:31:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/4-things-you-didnt-think-of-shredding</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6047e4c6dfc6544ed63c758e:6047f052f7b2925db6ce25fd:629eb0377e10696ca3e05f4b</guid><description><![CDATA[We understand the importance of shredding documents with sensitive

  <p class=""><strong>Updated July 2025</strong></p><p class="">When we think of shredding documents, the usual suspects come to mind: tax returns, bank statements, and anything with a Social Insurance Number. But protecting your identity requires more than just shredding the obvious. There are many everyday items that can be used to steal your identity, access your accounts, or gather private information — and most of us don’t even realize we should be shredding them.</p><p class="">If you’re wondering <strong>what documents to shred to prevent identity theft</strong>, here’s a list of often-overlooked items that should never be tossed in the trash or recycling bin without being shredded first.<br></p><h2>1. Shipping Labels &amp; Delivery Boxes</h2><p class="">With the rise of <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/3-easy-ways-to-be-safe-when-online-shopping-xmmba">online shopping</a>, it’s common to receive multiple packages a week. But have you ever looked closely at the shipping label before tossing the box? These labels often include your <strong>full name, address, phone number, and order tracking details</strong> — all of which can be used by identity thieves or scammers.</p><p class=""><strong>Before recycling delivery boxes</strong>, always remove the shipping label. Better yet, shred it. Even partial details on a label can help criminals piece together your personal profile.</p>

  <h2>2. Junk Mail and Pre-Approved Credit Offers</h2><p class="">Junk mail is more dangerous than it looks. Many of us toss out <strong>credit card offers, insurance promotions, or loan applications</strong> without a second thought. But these pre-approved offers can be stolen from your trash and used to open accounts in your name.</p><p class="">If you’re not opening it, that’s fine — but <strong>always shred junk mail that contains your name or address</strong>. Even basic information can be used for phishing scams or fraudulent activity.<br></p><h2>3. Boarding Passes and Travel Itineraries</h2><p class="">Think your boarding pass is harmless after a trip? Think again. <strong>QR codes and barcodes</strong> on boarding passes can contain sensitive data such as your full name, frequent flyer number, and even passport details.</p><p class="">Even your <strong>travel itineraries</strong> can include hotel bookings and rental car info — all useful for someone looking to impersonate you. Never discard these in hotel room bins or public trash cans. Instead, <strong>wait until you can safely shred them</strong> when you return home.<br></p><h2>4. Utility Bills and Service Statements</h2><p class="">We all know to shred financial statements, but many people overlook everyday bills — like <strong>gas, water, electricity, internet, or cell phone bills</strong>. These may seem harmless, but they include your account number, service address, and sometimes even partial banking info.</p><p class="">Scammers can use this data to <strong>change account settings, reroute services, or even open new utility accounts under your name</strong>. Make shredding utility bills part of your monthly routine.<br></p><h2>5. Medical Records and Prescription Labels</h2><p class="">Healthcare information is among the most valuable data on the black market. <strong>Prescription labels, doctor visit summaries, insurance claim forms, and lab results</strong> may all contain your date of birth, medical ID number, and condition details.</p><p class="">Always <strong>shred empty pill bottles or medication packaging that includes your name or prescription info</strong>. And never dispose of any document with your health information without shredding it first.<br></p><h2>6. Receipts with Signatures or Last Four Digits of Your Card</h2><p class="">While many retailers now mask your card number, <strong>some receipts still show the last four digits or include your name</strong>. Others — especially for returns or large purchases — may include your signature.</p><p class="">Shred receipts for <strong>credit card transactions, returns, or any purchase that includes identifying information</strong>, especially if you’re not planning to keep them for record-keeping.<br></p><h2>7. Old Resumes and Job Applications</h2><p class="">Think about the information a resume contains: your full name, phone number, email address, work history, and possibly even your home address or references. If an outdated copy falls into the wrong hands, it can be a <strong>treasure trove for scammers or spammers</strong>.</p><p class="">Old <strong>job applications, cover letters, and resumes</strong> should always be shredded once they’re no longer needed.<br></p><h2>8. Children’s School Documents</h2><p class="">Children are often targets for identity theft because their <strong>credit is a clean slate</strong>.

  <h3><strong>What Is Electronic Shredding?</strong></h3><p class=""><strong>Electronic shredding</strong> is the process of completely destroying data-containing hardware—such as hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), and backup tapes—by physically crushing or pulverizing the device. Unlike software-based data erasure or file deletion, physical destruction ensures that the data is <strong>unrecoverable</strong>.</p><p class="">A standard computer or laptop contains a hard drive that stores everything from saved passwords and emails to financial records and proprietary business files. If the hard drive is still intact when you discard your device, your private information is still accessible—no matter how many files you’ve deleted.</p><h3><strong>Why You Should Never Throw Away a Hard Drive Without Shredding It</strong></h3><p class="">Here are the top reasons you should always shred your electronic devices before disposal:</p><h4><strong>1. Deleted Files Aren’t Truly Gone</strong></h4><p class="">When you delete files from your desktop and empty the recycle bin, the file isn’t actually erased. Instead, your operating system simply marks that space on the hard drive as available. Specialized data recovery tools can still retrieve deleted files, even after reformatting.</p><p class=""><strong>Shredding electronics physically destroys the disk platters inside the drive</strong>, eliminating any possibility of recovery.</p><h4><strong>2. Overwriting Files Isn’t Foolproof</strong></h4><p class="">Some people try to overwrite files with new data to prevent recovery. However, unless you overwrite that space <strong>hundreds of times</strong>, traces of your original files can still be recovered by experienced hackers or forensic software.</p><p class="">In contrast, <strong>hard drive shredding is fast, thorough, and permanent.</strong></p><h4><strong>3. DIY Destruction Can Leave You Vulnerable</strong></h4><p class="">Thinking about smashing your hard drive with a hammer? It might feel satisfying—but it’s not secure.</p><p class="">According to <a href="https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/hard-drive-shredder" target="_blank"><strong>TechTarget</strong></a>, even small fragments of unbroken data tracks on a hard drive platter can be used to recover information. Unless every part of every disk is destroyed, your data might still be accessible.</p><p class=""><strong>Only industrial shredders</strong>—like those used by professional services—can ensure total destruction of all data-bearing components.<br></p>

  <p class=""><strong>Updated June 2025</strong></p><p class="">Not everyone owns a paper shredder, but that doesn’t mean your private documents should be left vulnerable. Whether you’re decluttering your home office, protecting sensitive information, or disposing of old records, there are safe and effective ways to destroy paper documents without a shredder.</p><p class="">In this guide, we’ll explore the <strong>top methods to securely destroy paper without a shredder</strong>, including both manual and chemical approaches. These alternatives are ideal for small-volume paper destruction and can be a method to help protect you from identity theft or data breaches.</p><p class="">NOTE: These alternative methods to shredding are not fail-proof. Without <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/what-is-the-naid-aaa-certification"><span>NAID Certified shredding methods</span></a>, your documents could still be at risk using some of these other methods.<br></p><h3><strong>1. Tear Paper by Hand (With a Twist)</strong></h3><p class="">The most basic way to destroy paper is by manually tearing it into small pieces. While this method is time-consuming, it remains a practical solution for a few sheets at a time.</p><p class=""><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> To make this method more secure:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Tear the paper vertically and then horizontally into tiny pieces.</p></li><li><p class="">Separate the pieces into multiple garbage bags or containers.</p></li><li><p class="">Avoid placing the shredded paper in recycling bins—most facilities can’t process tiny or torn fragments properly.</p></li></ul><p class="">You can also use a <strong>hole puncher</strong> to puncture sensitive information, such as account numbers or signatures, before tearing the rest.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h3><strong>2. Use Paper Shredding Scissors</strong></h3><p class="">Specialty <strong>paper shredding scissors</strong>, which have multiple blades, are a more efficient alternative to tearing paper by hand. These scissors cut documents into thin strips quickly and are available at office supply stores or online.</p><p class=""><strong>Advantages of shredding scissors:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Affordable and easy to store</p></li><li><p class="">Safe to use, even for occasional tasks</p></li><li><p class="">Great for handling bank statements, bills, and junk mail</p></li></ul><p class="">After shredding, be sure to <strong>dispose of the paper securely</strong>, such as mixing it with compost or used coffee grounds before placing it in the garbage.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h3><strong>3. Burn Paper Responsibly</strong></h3><p class="">Burning documents is an age-old method of secure disposal. When done safely, it leaves zero chance for document recovery.</p><p class=""><strong>Safety tips for burning paper at home:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Use a fireproof container such as a metal barrel or fire pit.</p></li><li><p class="">Check local bylaws and fire bans, especially in Alberta’s dry summer season.</p></li><li><p class="">Never leave a fire unattended and always have water nearby.</p></li><li><p class="">Burn only small amounts of paper at a time to control flames and reduce smoke.</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Note:</strong> Burning is not environmentally friendly and should be used sparingly or when no other method is available.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h3><strong>4. Soak and Pulp Documents in Water</strong></h3><p class="">Soaking paper documents in water can effectively destroy the integrity of the paper, making it unreadable and easy to break apart.</p><p class="">Here’s how to do it:</p><p class=""><strong>Materials Needed:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Bucket or large container</p></li><li><p class="">Warm or boiling water</p></li><li><p class="">Optional: Baking soda, vinegar, or lemon juice</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Place the documents in the container.</p></li><li><p class="">Fill with water until the paper is fully submerged.</p></li><li><p class="">Add a small amount of baking soda or vinegar to help accelerate the breakdown.</p></li><li><p class="">Let the paper soak for 2–24 hours depending on the volume and thickness.</p></li><li><p class="">Once soaked, stir the mixture to create a paper pulp.</p></li></ol><p class="">After drying, the mushy remnants can be thrown in the trash or composted.<br></p><h3><strong>5. Use Household Chemicals (With Caution)</strong></h3><p class="">If you're looking for a faster breakdown of paper, some household chemicals can assist—<strong>but always use with extreme caution</strong>.</p><p class=""><strong>Potential agents:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Bleach</strong> – Can break down paper fibers, but toxic fumes are a risk.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Vinegar and lemon juice</strong> – Natural alternatives with mild acidic properties.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid)</strong> – Very effective, but dangerous and rarely recommended for home use.</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Important:</strong> Never mix chemicals, and always work in a well-ventilated area using protective gloves and eyewear. For most home users, sticking with water, vinegar, or baking soda is safest and sufficient.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h3><strong>6. Blend It in a Kitchen Blender</strong></h3><p class="">If you're dealing with a small volume of documents, consider turning them into pulp using a standard blender.</p><p class=""><strong>How to do it:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Tear paper into small pieces and soak them in water for a few hours.</p></li><li><p class="">Add the soaked paper to a blender with extra water.</p></li><li><p class="">Pulse until the paper becomes a slurry or pulp.</p></li></ol><p class="">This method is perfect for those who want to recycle the material into DIY paper crafts or simply make it unrecoverable before disposal.</p><p class=""><strong>Warning:</strong> Avoid using the same blender for food prep afterward.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h3><strong>Why Secure Document Destruction Matters</strong></h3><p class="">Identity theft and data breaches can start with something as simple as a discarded bank statement. Whether it’s utility bills, tax documents, or medical records, <strong>proper disposal of confidential documents</strong> is essential for protecting your personal information.</p><p class="">And if manual methods feel too time-consuming or risky?<br></p><h3><strong>Call in the Pros: Secure Mobile Shredding Services</strong></h3><p class="">If you have large volumes of documents or want complete peace of mind, consider hiring a professional shredding service like <strong>Merlin Shredding</strong>.

  <h3>Why Shredding Old Tax Documents Matters</h3><p class="">Once the six-year retention period is up, there’s no legal obligation to keep those records. In fact, keeping them longer than necessary increases the risk of your personal or business information falling into the wrong hands.</p><p class=""><strong>Outdated tax documents can contain sensitive data, including:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Social Insurance Numbers (SIN)</p></li><li><p class="">Business Identification Numbers (BIN)</p></li><li><p class="">Employee records</p></li><li><p class="">Financial transactions</p></li><li><p class="">Credit card or banking details</p></li></ul><p class="">If disposed of improperly, such documents can be used for <strong>identity theft, financial fraud, or corporate data breaches</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Identity Theft and Fraud in Canada</h3><p class="">In Canada, identity theft is a growing concern. According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, thousands of identity fraud reports are filed annually, with real financial consequences for individuals and businesses alike.</p><p class="">Dumpster diving remains a common method for criminals to access discarded paperwork containing personal information.

  <p class=""><strong>Updated April 2025</strong></p><p class="">In today’s digital world, simply deleting files from your hard drive isn’t enough. Sensitive information, even after being deleted, can still be recovered using advanced software. If you’re disposing of old computers or upgrading systems in your home or business, it’s crucial to ensure that your hard drive data is <strong>completely and irreversibly destroyed</strong>.</p><p class="">Whether you're a small business owner, a healthcare provider handling patient records, or an individual looking to protect personal data, secure hard drive destruction is a must. In Canada, protecting data also means staying compliant with privacy laws such as <strong>PIPEDA</strong> (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act).</p><p class="">So, how can you be sure your hard drive data is <strong>safely and permanently destroyed</strong>?</p><p class="">Here are the top four methods of hard drive destruction used across Canada, along with their pros, cons, and best-use scenarios.</p><h2><strong>1. Overwriting or Data Wiping (Disk-Wiping Software)</strong></h2><p class="">One of the most commonly used methods for erasing hard drive data is <strong>overwriting</strong>, also known as <strong>disk wiping</strong>. This process involves using specialized software to write over every sector of your hard drive with random sequences of ones and zeros. The goal is to render the original data unrecoverable.</p><p class=""><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Cost-effective, especially for individuals or small businesses</p></li><li><p class="">Can be done in-house with the right tools</p></li><li><p class="">Environmentally friendly</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Time-consuming, especially for large drives</p></li><li><p class="">Doesn’t physically destroy the drive, which may be a requirement in some industries</p></li><li><p class="">Must be performed by someone knowledgeable to ensure completeness</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Best For:</strong> Situations where the drive will be reused or recycled and physical destruction is not required. For businesses in Canada, make sure the software used meets <strong>government data sanitization standards</strong> (such as RCMP TBS standards).</p><h2>2. Degaussing (Magnetic Data Erasure)</h2><p class=""><strong>Degaussing</strong> involves using powerful magnets to disrupt and destroy the magnetic field of a hard drive. This process renders the data unreadable and effectively erases all stored information.</p><p class=""><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Quick and efficient</p></li><li><p class="">Permanent erasure of data from magnetic storage devices</p></li><li><p class="">Ideal for high-volume destruction needs</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Only works on magnetic storage devices (not solid-state drives or SSDs)</p></li><li><p class="">Equipment is expensive and must meet specific power thresholds</p></li><li><p class="">Degaussed drives are typically unusable afterward</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Best For:</strong> Organizations with bulk data destruction needs, such as healthcare, financial institutions, or government agencies. In Canada, ensure your degaussing equipment complies with the <strong>Communications Security Establishment (CSE)</strong> guidelines.</p><h2>3. Shredding (Physical Destruction)</h2><p class="">Hard drive shredding is one of the most effective and widely used methods of secure data destruction. This involves placing the drive into an industrial shredder that breaks it down into small metal fragments. The shredded pieces make data recovery impossible.</p><p class=""><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Fast and secure</p></li><li><p class="">Complies with Canadian data destruction regulations</p></li><li><p class="">Can destroy other electronics, including phones, tablets, and laptops</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Requires professional equipment or services</p></li><li><p class="">Drives are completely unusable afterward</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Best For:</strong> Businesses and individuals who want 100% assurance that their data is permanently destroyed. Shredding is especially popular for <strong>end-of-life IT asset disposal</strong>. In Canada, certified shredding companies like <strong>Merlin Shredding</strong> provide on-site and off-site destruction, with documentation such as a <strong>Certificate of Destruction</strong> for compliance and peace of mind.</p><h2>4. Disintegration (Advanced Mechanical Destruction)</h2><p class="">Disintegration takes the shredding process a step further. This method uses high-powered mechanical devices to cut hard drives into microscopic particles. The result is even smaller than with traditional shredding and is often used in <strong>top-security environments</strong>.</p><p class=""><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Maximum security – ideal for classified or sensitive information</p></li><li><p class="">Very small particle size makes data recovery impossible</p></li><li><p class="">Meets strict security standards for government and military data destruction</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Higher cost compared to other methods</p></li><li><p class="">Equipment is specialized and typically used by professional destruction companies</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Best For:</strong> Canadian organizations with strict security protocols such as law enforcement, defense contractors, or medical facilities storing sensitive health data.</p><h3>Why Secure Hard Drive Destruction Matters in Canada</h3><p class="">In Canada, data privacy is regulated by laws like <strong>PIPEDA</strong>, and various provinces have additional data protection legislation. Organizations that fail to properly dispose of old hard drives risk <strong>data breaches</strong>, legal liability, and significant fines.</p><p class="">Whether you’re a business handling customer data or an individual protecting your personal identity, ensuring that your hard drive is properly destroyed is critical.</p><h3>How Merlin Shredding Ensures Complete Hard Drive Destruction</h3><p class="">At Merlin Shredding, we understand that data security is non-negotiable. That’s why we provide:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Certified hard drive shredding services</strong> across Canada</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>On-site destruction</strong> for complete transparency</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Chain-of-custody documentation</strong></p></li><li><p class="">A <strong>Certificate of Destruction</strong> for every job</p></li><li><p class="">Ongoing <strong>security training for our employees</strong></p></li></ul><p class="">Our industrial shredders are capable of destroying hard drives, solid-state drives, mobile devices, and other forms of digital media. We follow all Canadian data protection standards and ensure that your data is completely unrecoverable.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p class="">When it comes to <strong>safely destroying hard drives in Canada</strong>, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The right method depends on the type of data, volume of devices, and level of security required. Whether you're overwriting, degaussing, shredding, or disintegrating your hard drives, the key is to work with a trusted provider who understands Canadian privacy laws and can guarantee complete data destruction.</p><p class="">If you’re ready to securely dispose of your hard drives, <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/contact-us">contact <strong>Merlin Shredding</strong> today</a> for a free quote or to schedule service.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6047e4c6dfc6544ed63c758e/1652726300173-LU99HNBK7SMTK155HP9K/Screenshot+2022-05-16+123814.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="885" height="595"><media:title type="plain">Top 4 Secure Methods for Hard Drive Destruction</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Securely Shredding Tax Documents: A Guide to Records Retention</title><dc:creator>Jenn Garman</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 21:30:14 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/securely-shredding-tax-documents-a-guide-to-records-retention</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6047e4c6dfc6544ed63c758e:6047f052f7b2925db6ce25fd:64b5b2087b26cd6a2457677f</guid><description><![CDATA[Keeping accurate and organized records is crucial when it comes to

  <p class="">Keeping accurate and organized records is crucial when it comes to fulfilling your tax obligations. However, once you no longer need to retain certain tax documents, securely shredding them is essential to protect your sensitive information. Here, we will explore records retention guidelines and provide you with insights on how long you should keep tax documents before safely disposing of them.</p><h2>Understanding Records Retention</h2><p class="">In Canada, maintaining proper records is fundamental for tax compliance. The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/keeping-records/where-keep-your-records-long-request-permission-destroy-them-early.html">Canada Revenue Agency</a> (CRA) outlines specific guidelines for records retention, which can vary depending on the type of documents. Generally, it is recommended to keep tax-related records for at least six years. This period ensures you meet the requirements set forth by the Income Tax Act and the Excise Tax Act. By adhering to these guidelines, you can effectively respond to potential audits, disputes, or inquiries from the CRA.</p><h2>Types of Tax Documents and Retention Periods</h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Income Tax Returns: Keep a copy of your filed income tax returns, including supporting documents, for at least six years from the end of the tax year to which they relate. This includes T4 slips, T5 statements, receipts, and any other documents used to calculate your income and deductions.<br></p></li><li><p class="">Business and Self-Employment Records: If you own a business or are self-employed, retain all financial records, such as sales receipts, invoices, and bank statements, for at least six years. Additionally, keep records of business-related expenses, payroll information, and employment records for the same duration.<br></p></li><li><p class="">Capital Assets: Hold on to records related to the purchase, sale, or disposal of capital assets, including real estate, stocks, or other investments, for at least six years after the asset is sold or disposed of. These records will help calculate capital gains or losses when needed.<br></p></li><li><p class="">Rental Properties: If you own rental properties, maintain records of rental income, expenses, and receipts for at least six years after the end of the last tax year they relate to.</p></li></ol><h2>Secure Shredding and Disposal</h2><p class="">When it is time to dispose of your tax documents, shredding is the most secure and recommended method. Shredding ensures that your sensitive information cannot be accessed or misused. Invest in a professional shredding service that follows strict protocols for document destruction, encourages <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/witnessing-the-destruction-of-personal-documents">witnessed document shredding</a>, and offers a <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/the-importance-of-a-certificate-of-destruction-when-shredding-documents">Certificate of Destruction</a> once the work is completed.</p><p class=""><br>Electronic records should be permanently destroyed using <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/destruction-of-electronics">secure electronics destruction methods</a>.

  <p class="sqsrte-large">While hiring a professional shredding service is a wise step toward safeguarding your personal data, there is one crucial aspect that should not be overlooked: witnessing the destruction process. Here, we explore the reasons why witnessing the destruction of personal documents is of utmost importance when utilizing professional shredding services.</p><h2>Maintaining Confidentiality</h2><p class="">One of the primary reasons to witness the destruction of personal documents is to ensure the <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/sending-documents-securely-7dh8s">preservation of confidentiality</a>. By being present during the shredding process, you can verify that your sensitive information is being handled with the utmost care and is not at risk of falling into the wrong hands. Witnessing the destruction also provides reassurance that the documents are not being mishandled or misplaced, which can potentially lead to data breaches or identity theft.</p><h2>Compliance with Legal Requirements</h2><p class="">Many industries, such as healthcare, finance, and legal sectors, are subject to stringent regulations concerning the handling and disposal of confidential information. Witnessing the destruction of personal documents allows you to comply with these legal requirements and demonstrate due diligence in safeguarding sensitive data. It ensures that you can provide a documented record of the destruction process if required for audits, regulatory inspections, or legal proceedings.</p><h2>Preventing Insider Threats</h2><p class="">Even with trusted professional shredding services, the risk of insider threats cannot be completely eliminated. By witnessing the destruction of personal documents, you have the opportunity to mitigate this risk. Observing the process provides an additional layer of security, deterring any potential internal threats who may be tempted to misuse or pilfer confidential information. It serves as a deterrent and encourages responsible handling of sensitive data among the personnel involved in the destruction process.</p><p class="">Merlin Shredding does background checks on <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/about-us">all of its employees</a>, has stringent hiring measures, and maintains onboard video systems to ensure your items are handled with the utmost security.</p><h2>Peace of Mind and Trust</h2><p class="">Lastly, witnessing the destruction of personal documents when using professional shredding services offers peace of mind and fosters trust. It allows you to have confidence that your <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/residential-mobile-shredding">confidential information is being destroyed</a> thoroughly and securely. By actively participating in the process, you can feel assured that you have taken all necessary steps to protect your privacy and maintain the integrity of your personal data.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">In an era where information security is a top concern, witnessing the destruction of personal documents when using professional shredding services is a crucial step toward maintaining confidentiality, complying with legal requirements, preventing insider threats, and fostering trust.

  <p class="sqsrte-large">In today's digital age, protecting sensitive information is of paramount importance. Whether you are an individual or a business, securely disposing of confidential documents is crucial to safeguarding your privacy and preventing potential data breaches. When it comes to shredding documents and other items, obtaining a Certificate of Destruction is a critical step to ensure the proper handling and <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/4-things-you-didnt-think-of-shredding"><span>disposal of sensitive materials</span></a>. Below, we will explore what a Certificate of Destruction is, its significance, and why it is essential for anyone engaged in document shredding.</p><h2>Understanding a Certificate of Destruction</h2><p class="">A Certificate of Destruction is a legal document issued by a <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/our-services">professional shredding service provider</a> to verify that specific documents or materials have been securely and irreversibly destroyed. It serves as tangible evidence that the documents have been properly disposed of, meeting the industry's highest standards of confidentiality and data protection.</p><h2>The Importance of a Certificate of Destruction</h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Compliance with Privacy Laws: Many countries have enacted strict privacy laws and regulations to protect individuals' personal information. These laws often require businesses and organizations to take appropriate measures when handling and disposing of confidential data. A Certificate of Destruction demonstrates compliance with such regulations, providing legal assurance that the documents have been destroyed in accordance with the prescribed guidelines.</p></li><li><p class="">Preventing Identity Theft: Identity theft is a pervasive concern in today's digital landscape. Shredding sensitive documents is an effective way to mitigate the risk of identity theft. However, without a Certificate of Destruction, there is no concrete proof that the documents have been completely destroyed. By obtaining a Certificate of Destruction, you have documented evidence that the confidential information contained within the shredded documents is beyond retrieval, minimizing the risk of identity theft.</p></li><li><p class="">Demonstrating Due Diligence: In the event of a <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/top-4-cyber-threats-to-businesses-in-2022">data breach or legal dispute</a>, having a Certificate of Destruction acts as a vital component of demonstrating due diligence. It showcases your commitment to protecting sensitive information and establishes a clear record of how you handle and dispose of confidential documents. This can be invaluable in legal proceedings, regulatory audits, or compliance checks.</p></li><li><p class="">Maintaining Customer Trust: As a business, <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/blog/7-facts-on-paper-shredding">safeguarding customer data</a> is crucial for maintaining trust and credibility. Obtaining a Certificate of Destruction when shredding customer records or other sensitive information communicates your commitment to protecting their privacy. It assures clients that their personal details are handled with the utmost care and professionalism, strengthening your reputation and fostering long-term customer relationships.</p></li><li><p class="">Environmental Responsibility: In addition to safeguarding privacy, responsible document disposal also entails considering <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/environmental-impact">environmental sustainability</a>. Shredded paper can be recycled and transformed into new products, reducing the strain on natural resources. A Certificate of Destruction assures that the shredded documents are disposed of responsibly, either through in-house recycling or by partnering with certified recycling facilities.</p></li></ol><h2>Merlin Shredding Provides Certificates of Destruction on Every Job</h2><p class="">At Merlin Shredding, your privacy and confidentiality is our top priority.

Here are some ways to ensure that your documents are securely saved and transferred efficiently.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Add a <strong>password</strong> to your PDF files. Add a layer of protection to your PDF documents - one of the most popular file formats in the office space - by adding a password.

A popular feature on platforms such as Google Docs, this tool allows for certain users to edit documents while allowing others to view only. This prevents users from outside your business network to modify your documents without permission.</p></li><li><p class="">Research <strong>digital signatures</strong>.

  <p class="">One of the reasons why phishing is so unfortunately effective is because of how convincing it can appear. Messages are addressed to you with your name, the language in the messages implies that they are familiar with your needs, and some scammers even reply to you personally, building what you may think is a sincere or genuine conversation. These exchanges slowly let your guard down and helps scammers gain your trust. However, being too vulnerable with scammers will have severe consequences including access to personal information.</p><h4>Phishing, Vishing, and its Other Relatives</h4><p class="">According to Webroot.com, there are <a href="https://www.webroot.com/ca/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-phishing" target="">11 types of phishing</a>. Here are four common types:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Phishing</strong> - An attack to steal sensitive data via email.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Smishing</strong> - An attack to steal sensitive data via SMS, or text.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Vishing</strong> - Short for “voice phishing”, vishing refers to scam callers posing as a government agency, tech support, or an organization. They attempt to extract personal information via phone calls or voice messages.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Pharming</strong> - A type of phishing that redirects the legitimate web traffic to a spoofed page without the user’s knowledge. This affects the DNS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/what-is-dns/" target="">Domain Name System</a>).</p></li></ol><p class="">Ensuring the security of your email, whether it is personal or professional, is imperative to your confidential data. Here are some quick ways on protecting yourself.</p>

At the time of this investigation, there was no available technology to determine whether or not there was any true security breach caused by the activity, but it was enough to raise alarms for the department. </p><h2>Technology Boundaries</h2><p class="">In the internal CIA investigation, it was found that the time of access on the adult sites did not line up with the times Deutch may have been at home. Media outlets speculated that the culprit may have been another household member who was sharing Deutch’s computer.</p>

  <p class="">Think about your own personal devices. It is fairly uncommon to share your device with your household members nowadays, as we each value our own privacy and maintenance of the device. If you were to lend your laptop to a family member, you would trust that they would not download illegitimate softwares or visit high-risk websites. </p><p class="">Now, put it in this perspective: your employer is lending you their computer for an extended period of time. Putting the device at risk could run some serious consequences, as business networks are likely to be a target for scams and hackers.</p>

  <h2>Wiping Off Your Personal Data</h2><p class="">It takes more than a simple click of the “reset settings” button to truly erase any records of sensitive information on your laptop. The only way to truly do so permanently is to <a href="https://www.merlinshredding.com/destruction-of-electronics">completely destroy the hardware</a>. However, this leads to more company expenses when a replacement is needed. </p><p class="">Alternatively, you may have to hand in your device to the IT department, who will assist in wiping down hard drives. Depending on the amount of information though, and whether or not you’ve run into some malware, this can be a complicated process. </p><h2>Assume You Are Always Being Monitored</h2><p class="">The best way to keep your internet surfing in check? Keep in mind that there may be some sort of employer surveillance or future disclosure of the activity on your device.

This has become a popular trend among shredding companies not only due to the environment aspect but in repurposing those shredded bits, it further destroys any information stashed in those pieces. By shredding and recycling just 1 ton of your paper waste/old documents you could be saving approximately 17 fully grown trees, 7000 gallons of water, 680 gallons of oil and 4,100 kilowatt hours of electricity. And it really is as easy as shredding your paper with a company like Merlin Shredding. We can come to you and help you make sure your paper is shredded and properly disposed of.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br><br></p>

  <p class="">As most businesses have switched to a hybrid style of working,  employers are once again determining the best ways to  keep their employees safe. What exactly is hybrid? A new workforce strategy that combines on-site and remote work arrangements. Any company may offer a range of hybrid work options, depending on the needs and nature of their line of work. For example, employees can split their time between in-person office settings and remote work locations, or certain employees may only work remotely while others may only work in the office.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hybrid work environments are gaining popularity. A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/05/12/securing-a-new-world-of-hybrid-work-what-to-know-and-what-to-do/" target="_blank"><span>Microsoft</span></a>&nbsp;survey shows that more than 80% of chief information security officers work in organizations that have started or already have a hybrid work environment. Employees are now actively seeking jobs that offer hybrid arrangements. And almost half of employees are looking for new jobs if their employer hasn’t adopted a flexible work model, something that has been coined recently as the great resignation.<br><br>Although a hybrid model can have high success for productivity, and employee satisfaction, there are risks from a data security standpoint. To take advantage of benefits while lowering risks, we’ve included 3 strategies to implement.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>1. <strong>Provide regular refreshers on data security policies</strong>. With employees carrying laptops, cell phones, tablets, and paper documents back and forth between locations, the risk of data theft increases, which puts companies at risk. As you modify hybrid arrangements, talk to employees about their information security responsibilities and how they can help protect sensitive information. Some things to include:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The importance of passwords - using complex passwords, keeping them confidential, and changing them regularly</p></li><li><p class="">How to recognize phishing -  and what to do when an employee receives a suspicious email or text</p></li><li><p class="">How to properly dispose of unnecessary paper - especially documents that contain confidential information</p></li><li><p class="">The importance of keeping a clean desk- at work and at home to prevent information loss and theft</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>2. Have multiple layers of cybersecurity</strong>.&nbsp;The more electronic safeguards, the less likely a company is to experience a data breach. Critical protections should include multi-factor authentication, data encryption, firewalls, and antivirus software that updates as new threats appear. By examining various cybersecurity measures and helping employees protect their office and home computer systems, you can reduce risk while enabling easier data sharing between locations.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Facilitate secure document disposal</strong>. Although many companies are moving to paperless, there is still plenty of paper generated in the workday. Employees need to know what to do with documents they no longer need, whether working from home or in the office. Professional shredding is the safest document destruction strategy. By scheduling&nbsp;shredding events&nbsp;throughout the year with professional shredding companies, such as Merlin Shredding, businesses can ensure documents are destroyed safely and properly. You can also set up recurring pickups to help keep paper waste under control over time.<br>&nbsp;<br><em>Hybrid work environments are the new norm in our post-pandemic world. By creating a robust data protection strategy, businesses can offer flexible work arrangements and be assured that sensitive information will remain secure.

  <h2>2. Make sure you are on a trusted network and wifi.</h2><p class="">Once you’ve realized you need to order something, it can be tempting to order as fast as possible so you don’t forget to! But, before you start filling in your personal information, make sure you check that you are on a trusted shopping site and the right wifi. To check if the site is safe, look for a little padlock symbol in the url bar. Then, make sure you are on a private wifi connection. Once you have checked both, you are good to move forward with entering your private information!</p><h2>3.

  <p class="">Typically, printed documents get recycled by being placed in a recycle bin, with the exception of paper shreds and paper that is contaminated with grease or food. </p><p class="">Printed paper, newspaper, boxes, tin cans, glass jars, bottles and platstic containers and bags are acceptable with all recycling programs in Alberta.</p><p class="">However, when it comes to shredded paper, you <strong>should not be placing this with other items in your blue bag</strong> or apartment blue bin.</p><p class="">So <strong>what do you do to dispose of shredded paper?</strong> Take it to the Recycling Depot or put in your garbage. Even the City of Edmonton <a href="https://mydisposal.com/shredding-myths-shredded-paper">recommends that we separate our paper shreds </a>from our other recyclable waste. This is because During mechanical sorting, shredded paper often gets mixed in with the small pieces of glass or falls through the filter screen and recycling centers are unable to retrieve it.</p>

  <p class="">Now more than ever, identity theft is rising and data storage allowing larger amounts of information to be stored on one source means shredding is an essential activity in our workplaces.</p><p class="">Some of these additional threats include ID badges, laptops and computer hard drives, cellphones, and other devices. <br><br>With increased storage, no one can simply delete information and assume the data cannot be retrieved with advanced technology.   Grinding or shredding technology completely removes the data layering and coding sequences from all digital sources, reducing the information to powder.</p>

We’re sharing the best steps to implement effective fraud prevention tactics within your organization.</p><p class="">Research shows the average organization loses 5% of revenue to fraud per year, with more than 85% of occupational fraud cases involving employee theft. Ensuring effective fraud prevention measures are in place is much more cost-effective than spending resources at a later time on recovery and investigation.  </p><p class="">Arguably the most effective mechanism for preventing fraud is convincing employees that attempts to defraud the company will be quickly detected. When deciding to steal, fraudsters typically do not anticipate being caught. In fact, many fraudsters start out believing that they will only steal once and then put the money back as soon as they can, before anyone notices — although most never do. Consequently, increasing the perception of detection — even more than the threat of sanctions — can effectively deter many tempted employees from engaging in that first fraudulent act.</p><p class="">We’ve included six steps on establishing a work environment that effectively creates a strong work environment while reducing employee risk for engaging in fraudulent activity. </p>
